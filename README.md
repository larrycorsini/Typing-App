# Gemini Type Racer

Welcome to Gemini Type Racer, a modern, feature-rich typing game where you can test your speed and accuracy against dynamic AI opponents, race against your own best performance, and track your progress with persistent stats and achievements. The typing passages are generated on-the-fly by Google's Gemini API, providing a unique challenge every time.

## üöÄ Architectural Overview

This project is built with a modern frontend architecture focused on scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

### Project Structure

The codebase is organized into logical directories:

-   `components/`: Contains reusable React components that make up the UI.
-   `services/`: Houses modules that handle external interactions and business logic (e.g., `geminiService`, `achievementService`, `soundService`).
-   `hooks/`: Includes custom React hooks for managing complex, reusable component logic (e.g., `useTypingGame`, `useFocusTrap`).
-   `store.ts`: The central Zustand store, acting as the single source of truth for all global application state.
-   `types.ts`: A centralized file for all TypeScript type definitions and interfaces.

### Core Concepts

#### State Management with Zustand

The application's state is managed by a centralized **Zustand store** (`store.ts`). This approach was chosen over component-level state (`useState`) to handle the app's growing complexity and avoid prop-drilling.

-   **Single Source of Truth**: All critical game state, UI state, and player data reside in the store.
-   **Actions**: State mutations are handled by clearly defined actions within the store, making state changes predictable.
-   **`AppStateSync` Component**: A unique bridge component that synchronizes the state from the `useTypingGame` hook (which contains the core typing logic) with the global Zustand store. It also manages the main game loop (`setInterval`).

#### Accessibility (a11y)

Accessibility was a primary consideration during development.
-   **Focus Trapping**: The `useFocusTrap` custom hook ensures that when a modal is open, keyboard focus is trapped within it, preventing users from accidentally tabbing to elements in the background. It also allows closing modals with the `Escape` key.
-   **Semantic HTML & ARIA**: Proper HTML5 elements and ARIA attributes (e.g., `role`, `aria-modal`, `aria-label`) are used to provide context to screen readers and other assistive technologies.
-   **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are fully navigable and operable using only a keyboard.

#### Dynamic Content Generation

The `geminiService.ts` is responsible for all interactions with the **Google Gemini API**. It dynamically constructs prompts based on the user's selected theme and difficulty, ensuring a fresh and relevant typing challenge for every race. It includes robust error handling with a fallback paragraph to maintain a seamless user experience.
