## üöÄ How to Run the App (Frontend & Backend)

This project consists of a frontend (the React app) and a backend (a Node.js server for online features). You need to run both for all features to work.

### 1. Running the Frontend

The frontend is set up in a build-free development environment. There are no command-line tools or installation steps required.

-   **Live Preview**: Simply interact with the live preview panel.
-   **Automatic Updates**: Any changes made to the code are automatically compiled and updated in the preview panel in real-time.

### 2. Running the Backend Server

The backend server powers the Online Multiplayer and Daily Challenge modes.

-   **Prerequisites**: You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
-   **Installation**:
    1.  Create a `package.json` file in the root directory with the following content:
        ```json
        {
          "name": "gemini-type-racer-server",
          "version": "1.0.0",
          "description": "",
          "main": "server.js",
          "scripts": {
            "start": "node server.js"
          },
          "keywords": [],
          "author": "",
          "license": "ISC",
          "dependencies": {
            "ws": "^8.17.0"
          }
        }
        ```
    2.  Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
-   **Running the Server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    You should see the message `Gemini Type Racer WebSocket server started on port 8080...` in your terminal. **Keep this terminal window open while you use the app.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Zustand, Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend**: Node.js
-   **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets (`ws` library)
-   **Core API**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
-   **Audio**: Web Audio API

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Overview

The application is architected for scalability and maintainability, with a clear separation between the frontend and backend.

-   **Frontend**: A single-page application built with React. Global state is managed by a centralized **Zustand store** (`store.ts`), providing a single source of truth. Logic is cleanly separated into components, services (for business logic like API calls), and hooks.
-   **Backend (`server.js`)**: A lightweight Node.js server that uses the `ws` library to handle WebSocket connections. It is responsible for:
    -   Managing online race rooms and player states.
    -   Broadcasting player progress to everyone in a room in real-time.
    -   Serving the daily challenge text to ensure consistency for all players.
-   **Communication (`websocketService.ts`)**: A client-side service that acts as the bridge between the React app and the backend server, managing the WebSocket connection and message flow.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Connection Errors

If you see a "Connection to server failed" message or errors in the console related to WebSockets, it almost always means the backend server is not running.

**Solution:**
1.  Open a terminal in the project's root directory.
2.  Run the command `node server.js` (or `npm start` if you created the `package.json`).
3.  You should see the message `Gemini Type Racer WebSocket server started on port 8080...`.
4.  Keep this terminal open and refresh the application.
